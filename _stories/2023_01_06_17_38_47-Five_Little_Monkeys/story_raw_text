Once upon a time, there were five little monkeys who lived in a tree. They were always full of energy and loved to play.

One day, the five little monkeys decided to go exploring. They jumped from branch to branch, looking for something new and exciting.

Suddenly, they heard a loud noise coming from the ground below. It was a lion! The five little monkeys were so scared that they quickly climbed up the tree and hid in the leaves.

The lion roared and paced around the tree, trying to find the monkeys. But the monkeys were too clever for him and stayed hidden.

After a while, the lion gave up and left. The five little monkeys were so relieved that they all hugged each other and celebrated their victory.

From then on, the five little monkeys were always careful when they went exploring. They knew that danger could be lurking around any corner. But they also knew that they could always rely on each other to stay safe.
